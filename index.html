            <p>For my first univerity assignment in "Introduction to Gameplay Programming," I was given instructions to improve on the original Asteroids (1980) game for my Game Development Course.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was the first game I had ever made in game maker. In which I choose to add a rogue like element to it (Ik very Indie of me). The game itself isn't too special but the back-end of the game relatively future proofed just in case I choose to work on it again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I had designed the backend of the game really well. Shoot me a message if you are intrested at looking at the <a href="https://github.com/ChopsDev/GD1P05_Assignment_1_Asteroid_Overcharge">repository</a></p>

              <p>Stepping Stones is a minimalist 2D platformer built in Unity, which I created while battling cancer and was inspired by 
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/">Downwell</a>
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>The project lasted about 5–6 months and gave me the chance to design and program a complete game loop.
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>The core gameplay is simple: players jump left and right, aiming for height or speed depending on the chosen height. 
                Despite the basic nature of the game the controls are responsive and snappy, creating an enjoyable replay loop. 
                High scores are saved, and coins collected during jumps can unlock cosmetic variations for added progression.
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>The art style is intentionally minimalist. I created all sprites and animations myself, 
                drawing heavily from Downwell’s approach to clean UI/UX and impactful presentation.
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>On the technical side, the project features a custom camera scaling system that affects FOV, jump speed, 
                and sound design. Touch controls and resolution scaling were also built in which means making a mobile port is possible but not implemented. 
                The jumping is fully code driven and the whole game is framerate independent
              </p>

              <p>Tilting Game was made as a way for me to make a simple game from my childhood. At the time, I wasn't great at thinking small, so I needed something with an existing foundation. That's when I remembered Labyrinth which was a physics-based game built around trial and error, where the goal was simply to reach the end without falling into holes.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The game itself is solid and, with a somewhat replayable experience designed with speedrunners in mind. It also includes customization which let players change both the ball and the background skybox. While the feature is poorly implemented, figuring out how to add it taught me how to properly implement customization in future projects.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Making this game was a good learning experience for me, as it was my first time working in a 3D environment. It introduced me to <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> for asset creation and allowed me to experiment with world-space UI in Unity, a concept I hadn't explored before.</p>

            I enjoy experimenting with ideas I come up with and turning them into small, complete

          <p>The weird thing about this panel isn't the art itself. it's that I had to work against my GPU as it was glitching out. The main issue I found when I worked around it is that the files would never look the same each time I moved or reopened the file. The GPU was constantly changing the project itself. So when I moved the screen or reopened it after a crash the design would take on a new shape or change where everything was placed.</p>
