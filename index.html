          <p><b>Game</b> started from me pleying with my cousin and looking at the toys that she had, which I came across -game name- which was a game about trying to get to the end using trail and error using physics as its foundation.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As I was devoliping the game it taught and solidified the basis of game Develoment, with me also learning new things I had never delt with before. First the game was in 3D which was a first for me so it allowed me to learn the basics of blender as well, since the game was in unity I was able to utilize world space UI.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The game is solid, with it having small reasons to replay the game with the game being speedrunner friendly and there being the ability for customizeation for the ball as well as the background skybox. Yes, you can choose the ball and skybox right off the bat but with the implamentation it showed me how one could add customizeation to any future game</p>

          <p><b>Stepping Stones</b> was a game I chose to create within unity as a way to pass time while I was undergoing chemotherapy. The Develoment was challenging for me, taking roughly 5 to 6 months to complete. It allowed me to learn and understand how to make a game that feels enjoyable and responsive to play.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Though the game's art style is minimalist, I took heavy inspiration from the 2D platformer Downwell, making all the sprites and animations myself while incorporating similar UI/UX designs from <a>Downwell</a> had.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The game itself doesn't have much for the player to do other than jumping left to right, but the game is responsive and snappy and has a basic replayability loop. With player's highscores saved based on the tile height or speed depending on the chosen height. The game also has simple cosmetics that can be unlocked by collecting coins for each jump the player does.</p>
